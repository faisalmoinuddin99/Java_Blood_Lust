What is abstract class?

--> Partially implemented class, can be delare as abstract.

If you feel implementation is not proper, then you can make that class as abstract.

Q. Is it possible to create object for abstract class?
ANS.
    No, not possible because if class implementation is not proper then object creation should not
    be allowed.
