what is the reason for below error ?

-->  error: A is not public in pack1; cannot be accessed from outside package
import pack1.A ;

ANS. we get the above error when, even though the members of the class is public but the main class is 
not public.

So, if the members are decalare as public you can access that memeber anywhere with-in the package
or outside the package, but make sure the corresponding class also visible. 

If class is not visible and members are public then its of no use.


Q. Default memeber: default memebers are only accessable with-in the same package.

So if any memeber or variable delcare as default, we can access those variable or memebers only
with in a current package. 

default is also known as package level modifier.


Q. Private Access modifier: If memebers are defined as private, then it means that member is 
only accessable within the same class

private is also known as class level modifier.

private -> class level
default -> package level
public -> global level


Data members: variable (private) highly recommended
              
              Methods (public) recommended


Q. Protected modifier:  protected = < default > + child

If a variable or Methods decalared as protected then we can access that members with-in the same package 
anywhere but outiside package only in child classes.

From outside we cant use parent reference to access protected members
