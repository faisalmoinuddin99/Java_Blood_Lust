what is the reason for below error ?

-->  error: A is not public in pack1; cannot be accessed from outside package
import pack1.A ;

ANS. we get the above error when, even though the members of the class is public but the main class is 
not public.

So, if the members are decalare as public you can access that memeber anywhere with-in the package
or outside the package, but make sure the corresponding class also visible. 

If class is not visible and members are public then its of no use.
