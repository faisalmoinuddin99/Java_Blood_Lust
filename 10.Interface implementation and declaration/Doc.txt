Points to be remember*

✔️ Whenever we are implementing an interface method complusory that method should 
declare as " public ".

✔️ Whenever we are implementing an interface for each and every abstract method of that 
interface, we should provide implementation. If you are unable to provide implementation
for at least one abstract method declare the class as " abstract" .

✔️ Then who is the responsible to provide implementation for next remaining abstract method ?
child class will be responsible.
