******* Abstract Methods ********

1. public and default are class level modifiers

2. what is the meaning of abstact?
--> abstract means not completed or partial complete.

3. we can have abstract method and abstract class but not abstract variables.

4. If you dont know about implementation then you can happily make the method as abstract.

5. abstract methods only have declaration but no implementation.

6. abstract method declaration should ends with ";" semicolon but nor "{}" curly braces

7. Example: 

class Test {

    public abstract void m1(){}
}

if you run above code you will get below error:

Test.java:1: error: Test is not abstract and does not override abstract method m1() in Test
class Test {
^
.\Test.java:3: error: abstract methods cannot have a body
    public abstract void m1(){}
                         ^
