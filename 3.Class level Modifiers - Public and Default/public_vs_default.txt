1. Modifiers describes the behaviour of the class

2. If the class is "public" you can access this class anywhere

3. If class is having no modifiers then "default" modifiers is assign to that class,
we can access defualt methods and classes within the same package. I have included the example

4. If class is "abstarct" object creation is not allowed

5. If class is "final" child class creation not possible


Top Level Class                     vs                  Inner class

public                                                  private
<default>                                               protected
abstarct                                                static
final
strictfp

6. Top Level class include only 5 access modifiers, whereas Inner class can access 8 modifiers

7. which is 5 access modifiers from Top Level classes  + 3 access modifiers from Inner class
