Q. What if we remove abstract method from parent class? what will gonna happen ?

Ans. The code will compile successfully, but the biggest advantage is

If we dont take abstract methods in parent class, child class may provide implementation
OR may not provide implementation.

That means those methods become "optional"

But if we declare abstract method in parent class then that abstract class become mandatory
to implement.
